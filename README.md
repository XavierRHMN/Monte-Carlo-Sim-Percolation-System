# Percolation Monte Carlo Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates percolation on an n×n grid using a Monte Carlo approach. It repeatedly opens random sites until the system percolates, then estimates the percolation threshold by averaging results over many trials.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) — version 11 or newer
- Git Bash

## Usage
1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XavierRHMN/Monte-Carlo-Sim-Percolation-System.git
   ```
2. cd into the working directory
   ```bash
   cd Monte-Carlo-Sim-Percolation-System
   ```
3. Activate git bash terminal within working directory
   ```bash
   bash
   ```
4. Run:

   ```bash
   java-algs4 PercolationStats grid_size trials
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   java-algs4 PercolationStats 20 100
   ```

## Notes
* Any command prefixed with java-algs4 must be run from **Git Bash**, not PowerShell or CMD.
